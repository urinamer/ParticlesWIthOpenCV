# FruitNinja with computer vision

Fruit ninja clone using computer vision to detect finger slices and cut the fruit.
The game uses openCV to create a simple window to dislay the camera and 
draw the fruits, and detect the momvment of your fingers based on color detection.
Currently I ran into some trouble because color detection just isn't good enough to detect a fast moving finger so
I am taking a break from this project to hopefully learn some machine learning in python the train an algorithm which will replace 
the color detection and bring smoother results!
